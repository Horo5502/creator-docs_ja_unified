* Browse the list and select an example to see more information about it.
* Once selected, the example's details are shown on the right.
* Press the "Docs" button to open a page with detailed information and a walkthrough of using the example.
* Press the "Import" button to import the example's `.unitypackage` into your project.

## Example Details

Each example has a thumbnail, title, version, tags, description, guide, and example scene. World examples also have a published VRChat world. Lots of information to help you get started!

### Version

Each example has a version indicator. When an example is updated, you'll see the newest version in Example Central.

Examples use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

:::warning

Currently, you cannot see the version of an example after importing it. This makes it difficult to see whether you are using the latest version. 

In the future, versions will have release notes and a mechanism to check whether you're using the latest version.

### Tags

Look at the tags of examples to quickly understand the systems and concepts involved. You can search for any tag to filter the list of examples.

### Guide

Each example has a detailed guide in the Creator Docs, which you can access by pressing the "Docs" button in the window.

### Example World

Visit the example world in VRChat to get a better understanding of how the example works on each platform!


### Settings

The gear icon (‚öô) beside the search box opens up the settings of Example Central. 

![Example Central Window Layout](/img/sdk/example-central/ec-settings.png)

There are two settings:
- Show Creator Economy Examples
- Show Persistence Examples

:::warning

Both settings are disabled by default because they are currently in Beta testing. You can enable them, but they will not function properly if you are not a Beta tester.
