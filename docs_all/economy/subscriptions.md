# Subscriptions

import SellerNotification from '/docs/economy/_sellers-notification.mdx';

<SellerNotification/>

Subscriptions are the easiest way to monetize your VRChat group. Users can visit your group store to buy a subscription. They receive a group role as a reward, but you can also grant them additional group permissions or Udon products.

Subscriptions are similar to [listings](/economy/listings).

## Subscriptions, roles, and products

Each subscriptions consists of a subscription, a subscription role product, and a subscription role. Here's how they're related:

<Column className='text--left'>

### Subscription

Users buy subscription in your group [store](/economy/store). Subscribers gain access to the subscription's [products](/economy/products/). They lose access when their subscription ends.

Each subscriptions contains exactly one [subscription role product](#subscription-role-product). You can also add multiple [Udon products](/economy/products/udon).



</Column>
<Column className='text--left'>

### Subscription role product

Users who own this [product](/economy/products/) gain access to a [subscription role](#subscription-role) in your group.

When you create a subscription, you automatically create a role product. You cannot create subscription role products manually.

## Details about renewal, payout, and cancellation

When you use subscriptions to monetize your VRChat group, remember the following details:

- Subscriptions do not automatically renew when their duration expires.
	- Users see a notification when their subscription is about to expire.
- Users can extend their subscription before their current subscription ends.
	- For example: If a user's subscription expires in 7 days, and they buy a 12-month subscription, their subscription is extended to 12 months and 7 days
- When a user subscribes, you receive VRChat Credits for the first month immediately. If they subscribe for more than one month, you receive the remaining credits every month.
	- For example: If a user subscribes for 12 months, you immediately receive the VRChat Credits for the first month. Next month, you will receive the VRChat Credits for the second month, and so on.
- You do not receive VRChat Credits for remaining months when a user cancels their subscription.
	- For example: If a user subscribes for 12 months and immediately cancels, you only receive VRChat Credits for the first month.
- The subscription price includes a ~15.3% transaction fee.
	- See [CE Program Rules](https://hello.vrchat.com/legal/economy) and [Payout](/economy/payout).
