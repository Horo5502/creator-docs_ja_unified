# Subscription Role Product

All [subscriptions](/economy/subscriptions) contain a subscription role product. This product automatically makes them a member of your group gives them a subscription role. You can give users with subscription roles special permissions, such as as access to announcement, group instances, or priority queues.  

Subscription roles are always connected to a single [subscription](/economy/subscriptions). Unlike [Udon products](/economy/products/udon), you cannot manually add or remove subscription role products a subscription.

## Create a subscription role product

You can create a subscription role product by creating a subscription or creating a paid role.

### Create a subscription

[Create a subscription](/economy/subscriptions) on the [My Subscriptions](https://vrchat.com/home/marketplace/storefront/subscriptions/page/1) page. This is the easiest way to create a subscription role product.


### Create manually

You can create a subscription role product manually, which also creates a subscription for you. This process is more complex than creating a subscription first.
