## Payment Processing ##

#### What are VRChat Credits?
VRChat Credits (![VRChat Credit icon](/img/economy/Icons_Credits@20.svg)) are VRChat's currency for the Creator Economy. They are similar to premium currencies found in other video games.
Users can purchase VRChat Credits and spend them on creators.
Creators can pay out their earnings for real money!

#### What’s the conversion of VRChat Credits to USD?

When you request a [payout](/economy/payout), your earned VRChat credits are paid out at the following rate:

1![VRChat Credit icon](/img/economy/Icons_Credits@20.svg) ≈ 0.005 US$

211![VRChat Credit icon](/img/economy/Icons_Credits@20.svg) ≈ 1.05 US$

In other words, if your listing costs 1200![VRChat Credit icon](/img/economy/Icons_Credits@20.svg) (≈10 US\$), your earned [payout](/economy/payout) is approximately 5 US\$. 

Please refer to the [Creator Economy Program Rules](https://hello.vrchat.com/legal/economy) and the [payout documentation](/economy/payout) to learn more.

#### What's the revenue split? ####
After VRChat Credits have been purchased, spent, and cashed out, ...

## Miscellaneous

#### Am I allowed to make changes to my listings and subscriptions?

Yes. You may change listings, subscriptions, and the products they contain. Depending on your content, users may expect different types of changes, additions, or removals. This helps you support your existing customers and improve your content. 

However, don't "bait-and-switch" users by taking away their purchases unexpectedly. Don't deceive users.

#### Do users have to be part of my group to buy a subscription?

Yes, but you can allow users to join your group by enabling the [Enable Free Join for Subscribers](/economy/subscriptions#4-role-permissions) setting in your subscription role settings.

Users can leave your group after buying a subscription. They lose access to their subscription role, but keep all products until the subscription expires. 

#### Can I split my earnings with another creator? ####
There is currently no split pay functionality. The [Payout](/economy/payout) process is only available to the seller.

#### Can a listing be free? ####
No, not at this time. However, for [testing](/economy/sdk/testing), sellers can purchase their own listings for free in VRChat.

#### Where can I provide feedback? ####
VRChat uses Canny for our community feedback and bug reports. Feel free to post on the Creator Economy section of our [feedback page.](https://feedback.vrchat.com/creator-economy)

#### If a creator deletes a product, will that automatically update/delete any listings that contain that product? ####
