## How to Use

For each prefab, you'll need to replace any ID with the ID of your own group.

1. Select the chosen prefab in your Unity scene.
2. Set the ID of the group that owns the product in the `Group ID` field in the inspector window.
    -   Find your group ID by opening your group [on the website](https://vrchat.com/home/groups) and copying the ID in the address bar of your browser. For example: `grp_a4f791af-a167-4c91-b849-2e37e37f509a`. Any short code (i.e. `EXAMPL.9920`) will **not** work.

3. Toggle the **OpenToStorePage** toggle on the prefab if you want to open to your store page directly. If unchecked, the button will open to your group page instead of directly to your store.

6. Run Build & Test!
