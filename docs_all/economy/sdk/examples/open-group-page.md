# Open Group Page

OpenGroupPage is a prefab that makes it easier for users to access purchasable CE listings. Use it to create buttons that open group pages or specific listings.

### How to Import
1. Download the Example from [Example Central](https://vrc-beta-docs.netlify.app/sdk/example-central).
2. Import the Unity package into your project.
3. Drag your chosen prefab into your scene. The options are:

##### Prefabs included
* **OpenGroupPagePrefab**: Includes a button that opens a group page. Also includes a text description.
* **OpenGroupPageSimplePrefab**: Includes a button that opens a group page. Does not include a text description.

* **OpenListingSimplePrefab**: Includes a button to open to a listing page. Does not include a text description.

### How to Use

For each prefab, you'll need to replace any ID with the ID of your own group or product.

1. Select the chosen prefab in your Unity scene.
2. For **OpenGroupPage/OpenGroupPageSimple:** Set the ID of the group that owns the product in the `Group ID` field in the inspector window.
    -   Find your group ID by opening your group [on the website](https://vrchat.com/home/groups) and copying the ID in the address bar of your browser. For example: `grp_a4f791af-a167-4c91-b849-2e37e37f509a`. Any short code (i.e. `EXAMPL.9920`) will **not** work.

3. For **OpenListing/OpenListingSimple/OpenListingDeluxe:** Set the ID of the listing in the `Listing ID` field in the inspector window.
    - Find your listing ID by [opening the listing section](https://vrchat.com/home/marketplace/storefront/listings) of your store and copying its ID.

4. For **OpenListingDeluxe**:
    - Set the Thumbnail for the listing using the `Thumbnail` field in the inspector window. It's best if you use the same thumbnail that the user will see when opening your listing, but you have the ability to use any square Sprite in your project.
    - Set the three text lines using the `Display Name`, `Type` and `Price` fields. Just like the thumbnail, it's best if these match what the user will see in your listing, but you can enter any information you like.

5. Toggle the **OpenToStorePage** toggle on the prefab if you want to open to your store page directly. If unchecked, the button will open to your group page instead of directly to your store.
