# Example Prefabs

import SellerNotification from '/docs/economy/_sellers-notification.mdx';

<SellerNotification/>

Example Prefabs allow world creators to use the Creator Economy quickly and easily without writing their own Udon scripts. The prefabs can be tweaked and customized to create a better experience for your supporters.

Many of the examples require knowledge on how to set up Udon products, which should be done before you proceed here. Head to our [Getting Started with the Creator Economy SDK page](/economy/sdk/getting-started/) to learn more.

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />

## Adding Prefabs

Each prefab shares the same starting steps:

1. Download the Unity package for the prefab you need, which can be found in the left sidebar.

2. Import the package into your Unity project.
