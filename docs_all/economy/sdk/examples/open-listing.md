## How to Use

For each prefab, you'll need to replace any ID with the ID of your own group or product.

1. Select the chosen prefab in your Unity scene.

2. Set the ID of the listing in the `Listing ID` field in the inspector window.
    - Find your listing ID by [opening the listing section](https://vrchat.com/home/marketplace/storefront/listings) of your store and copying its ID.

3. For **OpenListingAndReactToPurchase** only:
    - Use the [UdonProducts Manager](https://creators.vrchat.com/economy/sdk/getting-started#udonproducts-manager) to locate the `UdonProduct` asset of the product that should play a sound effect when purchased.
    - Set the `Trigger Product` field to the `UdonProduct` asset.

4. For **OpenListingDeluxe** only:
    - Set the Thumbnail for the listing using the `Thumbnail` field in the inspector window. It's best if you use the same thumbnail that the user will see when opening your listing, but you have the ability to use any square Sprite in your project.
    - Set the three text lines using the `Display Name`, `Type` and `Price` fields. Just like the thumbnail, it's best if these match what the user will see in your listing, but you can enter any information you like.
