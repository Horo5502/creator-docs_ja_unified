# Creator Economy

import SellerNotification from './_sellers-notification.mdx';

<SellerNotification/>

The Creator Economy allows group owners to set up a store in VRChat. They can sell subscriptions to their supporters, which reward them with benefits in the group and in the creator's VRChat worlds.

Users can buy subscriptions by spending VRChat Credits. Creators can earn VRChat Credits and pay them out with Tilia and PayPal, if eligible.

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />

The Creator Economy is still in development. In the future, whether creators make avatars, worlds, or other experiences, VRChat will offer different solutions to empower creators.
