# ClientSim

:::warning

This documentation explains ClientSim's latest features but is incomplete.

For a more comprehensive overview of ClientSim, please visit the [ClientSim documentation](https://clientsim.docs.vrchat.com/).

The ClientSim Settings window and PlayerData window are also visible.](/img/worlds/clientsim/clientsim-screenshot.png)

ClientSim, short for client simulator, is a part of the Worlds SDK that replicates VRChat client behavior in the Unity editor and can be used to speed up development.

## Features

- Test your World in Unity without needing to open VRChat.
- Control the player with your Mouse and Keyboard or a Gamepad.
- Inspect Udon variables in Play Mode.
- Grab Pickups, use Interacts, UI, and Stations.
- Delete EditorOnly objects when entering Play Mode.

Always test your world in VRChat before making it public! ClientSim can't simulate all of VRChat's features. 
## Windows

ClientSim adds several Unity Editor windows to help you debug and test your world: 

- The ClientSim Settings allow you to change the local player's name and the player's height, disable ClientSim, and more.
- While in Play Mode, open an in-game settings window by pressing the "Escape" key.
- The [ClientSim PlayerData](playerdata-editor-window) window allows you to debug PlayerData.
- The [ClientSim PlayerObject](playerObject-editor) window allows you to debug PlayerObjects.

## Networking Differences in ClientSim

ClientSim only simulates the local VRChat player, not remote players. [Deserialization events](/worlds/udon/networking/network-components/#ondeserialization) are simulated for the local player, but not for spawned remote players.

Some parts of the VRChat server are simulated. For example, the local player receives a `OnPlayerRestored` events when you spawn a remote player.

ClientSim has a different implementation of VRChat's networking serializer. Due to this, there are differences in amount of data stored & serialized in event properties. Data in events like `OnPostSerialization` and `OnDeserialization` differs between ClientSim and the VRChat (see below).

### [OnPostSerialization(SerializationResult)](/worlds/udon/networking/network-components/#onpostserialization)

ClientSim only executes this event if it's part of a synced Player Object.

|                               | In ClientSim                                  | In VRChat                            |     |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --- |
| SerializationResult.success   | Always true                                   | True if serialization was successful |     |
| SerializationResult.byteCount | Number of properties serialized on the object | Number of bytes sent                 |     |


### [OnDeserialization(DeserializationResult)](/worlds/udon/networking/network-components/#ondeserializationdeserializationresult)

ClientSim only executes this event if it's part of a synced Player Object.

|                                     | In ClientSim    | In VRChat                                              |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| DeserializationResult.sendTime      | Always 0        | The time in seconds at which this message was sent.    |
| DeserializationResult.receiveTime   | Always 0        | The time in seconds at which this message was received |
| DeserializationResult.isFromStorage | Works as normal | True if sent from persistent storage                   |
