# Player Spawner
The PlayerSpawner system is responsible for spawning and initializing local and remote players. Players are spawned from a prefab, set to the location of a spawn point provided by the [SceneManager](scene-manager.md), and then initialized through the [PlayerManager](player-manager.md).
