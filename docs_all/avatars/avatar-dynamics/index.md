# Avatar Components

VRChat's Avatars SDK contains a suite of features to create fun and exciting interactions between avatars.

- [PhysBones](/avatars/avatar-dynamics/physbones) allows bones to be affected by physics or by other players.
- [Contacts](/avatars/avatar-dynamics/contacts) can detect collisions to trigger animations or effects.
- [Constraints](/avatars/avatar-dynamics/constraints) copies the movement of bones on your avatar.
- [Head Chop](/avatars/avatar-dynamics/vrc-headchop) allows you to hide or show bones from your first-person view.

PhysBones and Contacts are governed by the [Permissions and Settings](https://docs.vrchat.com/docs/permissions-and-settings) system, which gives you complete control over who can interact with you.

Learn more about PhysBones and Contacts by trying out the SDK's example avatar ("VRChat SDK" > "Samples" > "Avatar Dynamics Robot Avatar").
