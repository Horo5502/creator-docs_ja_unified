# Look At Constraint

The `VRCLookAtConstraint` component is a simplified [Aim Constraint](/avatars/avatar-dynamics/constraints/vrc-aim-constraint). It rotates the target transform so its positive Z axis faces towards the sources.

<ConstraintMainSettings />
- **Use Up Object** - Controls whether or not to use a separate transform to determine roll.
- **Roll** - Controls the angle (in degrees) around the target transform's Z axis that should be used to determine its upwards direction. Only available when `Use Up Object` is disabled.
- **World Up Object** - When set, the constraint will roll to try and point its positive Y axis towards this transform. Only available when `Use Up Object` is enabled.

<ConstraintActivation />

## Constraint Settings <!--Not partial because look-at does not expose freeze axes.-->

- **Rotation At Rest** - Defines the transform's rotation when the constraint's overall weight is 0.
- **Rotation Offset** - Defines the offset applied to the result of this constraint.
- **Lock** - When enabled, locks the `At Rest` and `Offset` values in place, preventing them from being edited.
  - If you activate the constraint and leave these values unlocked, they'll be recalculated as the target transform's rotation changes.
  - If you lock these values and activate the constraint, the constraint will start taking control of the transform.
