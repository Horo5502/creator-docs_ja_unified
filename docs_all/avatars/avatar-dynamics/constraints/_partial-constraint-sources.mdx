The "Sources" list determines which transforms affect this constraint. Click the `+` button in the bottom right to add a new source. Click the `-` button to remove the currently selected source. Each source has the following options:
- **Source Transform** - The transform to use as a source.
- **Weight** - Controls how much this source should affect the constraint.
  - This should normally be in the range 0 to 1, but you can tick the `Free edit` box if you want to set values outside of that range.
