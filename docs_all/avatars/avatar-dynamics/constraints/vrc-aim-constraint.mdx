# Aim Constraint

The `VRCAimConstraint` component rotates the target transform so it aims towards the sources. You can customize which direction is treated as forwards.

<ConstraintMainSettings />
- **Aim Vector** - Controls the axes that should face towards the sources.
- **Up Vector** - Controls the upwards axis for this constraint. This is the axis of the affected transform that the constraint will try to align with the world up axis defined below.
- **World Up Type** - Controls the world upwards direction used by this aim constraint.
  - **Scene Up** - Treat upwards as the positive Y axis of the scene.
  - **Object Up** - Treat upwards as the vector pointing from the target transform of the constraint to the transform specified in the `World Up Object` property.
  - **Object Up Rotation** - Treat upwards as the `World Up Vector` axis in the local space of the transform specified in the `World Up Object` property.
  - **Vector** - Treat upwards as the `World Up Vector` in world space.
  - **None** - Do not define an upwards direction.
